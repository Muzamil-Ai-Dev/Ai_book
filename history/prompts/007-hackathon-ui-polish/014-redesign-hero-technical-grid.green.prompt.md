# Prompt History Record - Redesign Hero to Technical Grid Aesthetic

## Prompt Text
User reported the previous visual polish looked "more worse" and requested a fix for the background color.

## Response Text
I pivoted from a "colorful/blobby" aesthetic to a "Technical Blueprint Grid" aesthetic.
- Implemented a CSS grid pattern background in the hero section.
- Added a radial gradient mask to fade the grid naturally towards the edges.
- Simplified the title gradient to Cyan-to-Mint (Dark Mode) and Solid Slate (Light Mode).
- Reduced background blob opacity to <10% for subtle atmospheric lighting.
- Increased hero padding for a more "expansive" and professional feel.

## Outcome/Evaluation
The result is a much cleaner, engineering-focused landing page that aligns better with a technical robotics textbook. Build successful.
