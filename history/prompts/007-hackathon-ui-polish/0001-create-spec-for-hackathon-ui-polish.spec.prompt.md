## Prompt

Elevate the website design to Hackathon-winning quality. Transform the current professional design into a premium, futuristic, and highly polished technical product. Focus on: 1. Advanced Landing Page: Add glowing glassmorphism effects, subtle background 'blob' animations, and a more dynamic hero section. 2. Interactive Elements: Add hover-triggered glow effects on module cards and buttons. 3. Typography & Brand: Refine font weights and spacing for a more high-end 'startup' feel. 4. Reading UX: Implement a custom, slim scrollbar and more sophisticated code block headers. 5. Motion: Integrate subtle entrance animations for sections to create a premium feel. Outcome: A site that looks like it belongs to a top-tier 2025 AI startup, ready to take 1st place in a hackathon.

## Response snapshot

Created a detailed feature specification for the "Hackathon-Winning UI & UX Polish" on a new branch `007-hackathon-ui-polish`. The specification focuses on high-impact visual elements like glassmorphism, background glow blobs, entrance animations, and custom scrollbars to elevate the textbook's perceived quality to a winning level.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: High. Defines the aesthetic bar for a top-tier competitive project.
- 🧪 Tests: Visual inspection and performance metrics defined as success criteria.
- 📁 Files: `specs/007-hackathon-ui-polish/spec.md`, `specs/007-hackathon-ui-polish/checklists/requirements.md`
- 🔁 Next prompts: `/sp.plan`
- 🧠 Reflection: Focusing on "Glow" and "Glassmorphism" provides a concrete path to a futuristic aesthetic without needing massive structural changes.
