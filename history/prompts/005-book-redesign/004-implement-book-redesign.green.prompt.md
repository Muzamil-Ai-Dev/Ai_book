## Prompt

Execute the implementation plan for the 'book-redesign' feature.

## Response snapshot

Implemented the full book redesign:
- **Infrastructure**: Configured Docs-only mode, autogenerated sidebars, and custom CSS.
- **Cleanup**: Removed default React landing page and components.
- **Content Structure**: Updated all 8 modules to follow the mandatory chapter schema (Learning Objectives, Prerequisites, Core Concepts, Examples/Exercises, Summary, References).
- **Auxiliary Pages**: Created standalone Glossary and Notation pages.
- **Validation**: Developed and successfully ran a `validate-content-structure.js` script.
- **Build**: Successfully compiled the site using `npm run build`.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: High. Massive improvement in professional look, navigation, and educational consistency.
- 🧪 Tests: Build passes, content validation script passes.
- 📁 Files: Modified config, CSS, and all chapter files. Created script and auxiliary pages.
- 🔁 Next prompts: Done.
- 🧠 Reflection: Fighting the MDX parser over LaTeX curly braces was the main challenge. Simplifying the notation resolved the build blocking issue.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: MDX compilation error with LaTeX curly braces.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS
- Prompt variant (if applicable): null
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Research proper escaping for complex LaTeX in MDX tables for future expansion.
