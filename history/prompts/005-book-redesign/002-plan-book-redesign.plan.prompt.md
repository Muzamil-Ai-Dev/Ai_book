## Prompt

Execute the implementation planning workflow for the 'book-redesign' feature.

## Response snapshot

Executed Phase 0 (Research) and Phase 1 (Design) of the implementation plan.
- **Research**: Decided on Docs-only root mode (`routeBasePath: '/'`), standalone pages for Glossary/Notation, and autogenerated sidebars.
- **Design**: Created `data-model.md` defining the content schema, `contracts/frontmatter.ts` for type safety, and `quickstart.md` for verification.
- **Plan**: Finalized `specs/005-book-redesign/plan.md` with technical context and project structure.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: High. Ready for task breakdown and implementation.
- 🧪 Tests: Verification steps defined in `quickstart.md`.
- 📁 Files: `specs/005-book-redesign/plan.md`, `specs/005-book-redesign/research.md`, `specs/005-book-redesign/data-model.md`, `specs/005-book-redesign/quickstart.md`, `specs/005-book-redesign/contracts/frontmatter.ts`
- 🔁 Next prompts: /sp.tasks
- 🧠 Reflection: The decision to switch to 'docs-only' mode simplifies the project structure significantly by removing the separate landing page maintenance.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)
