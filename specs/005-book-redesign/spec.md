# Feature Specification: AI-Native Textbook Design & UX Overhaul

**Feature Branch**: `005-book-redesign`  
**Created**: 2025-12-19  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Create a specification to improve the design, UX, and structural consistency of the existing AI-Native Textbook for Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics..."

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-12-19

- Q: How should the system handle chapters that do not currently have content for specific optional sections (e.g., "Examples / Exercises")? → A: Strict enforcement: Every chapter must have all sections; use "N/A" if empty.
- Q: Where should these standalone pages be primarily located in the UI for the best user experience? → A: Global Navbar: Add as persistent links in the top navigation bar.
- Q: Should we use Docusaurus autogenerated sidebars or maintain a manual sidebars.ts file? → A: Autogenerated: Sidebar structure strictly mirrors the file system hierarchy.
- Q: Should the "Intro" page be the primary landing page (homepage) of the site? → A: Direct to Intro: Configure Docusaurus to treat the Intro page as the site root (`/`).
- Q: Should the glossary be a single manual MDX file or individual term files? → A: Single File: One `glossary.md` file containing all terms alphabetically.

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### User Story 1 - Seamless Navigation & Discovery (Priority: P1)

As a student, I want to quickly understand the course structure and navigate to specific topics so that I can focus on learning without getting lost.

**Why this priority**: Navigation is the primary interface for the book. If users can't find content, the content value is lost. This establishes the structural skeleton.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by verifying the sidebar hierarchy and Intro page links without needing finalized chapter content.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am on the Intro page, **When** I look at the page content, **Then** I see a clear course overview, learning outcomes, and a guide on how to navigate the book.
2. **Given** I am browsing the sidebar, **When** I view the top-level items, **Then** I see a clear hierarchy: Intro → Modules → Chapters → Capstone.
3. **Given** I am looking for a specific module, **When** I expand a module in the sidebar, **Then** I see the relevant chapters nested within it.
4. **Given** I am deep in a chapter, **When** I want to switch modules, **Then** I can do so via the sidebar without returning to the home page.

### User Story 2 - Consistent Learning Experience (Priority: P1)

As a learner, I want every chapter to follow a predictable structure so that I can mentally parse information efficiently (e.g., always finding prerequisites at the top and summary at the bottom).

**Why this priority**: Cognitive load should be spent on the material, not the layout. Consistency is key for educational material.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating/refactoring one chapter per module to the new template and verifying structural identity.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I open any chapter, **When** the page loads, **Then** I immediately see the Title, Learning Objectives, and Prerequisites at the top.
2. **Given** I am reading a chapter, **When** I scroll to the end, **Then** I find a Summary and References section.
3. **Given** I am navigating between chapters in different modules, **When** I compare them, **Then** the visual layout and section ordering are identical.

### User Story 3 - Reference & Auxiliary Support (Priority: P2)

As a student encountering new terminology or math, I want quick access to a Glossary and Notation guide so that I can clarify concepts without leaving the book context.

**Why this priority**: Supports the learning process and reduces friction when encountering difficult technical concepts.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by verifying the existence and accessibility of standalone Glossary and Notation pages.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am reading a complex topic, **When** I need to check a term, **Then** I can navigate to a dedicated Glossary page.
2. **Given** I see a mathematical symbol I don't recognize, **When** I check the Notation guide, **Then** I find standard ROS/Robotics mathematical notations explained.

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a chapter is missing specific sections (e.g., no code examples)? The template should handle optional sections gracefully or placeholders should be used if strict adherence is required.
- How does the sidebar handle very long chapter titles? Should truncate or wrap appropriately on smaller screens.
- Mobile view behavior for the multi-level sidebar.

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- FR-001: System MUST provide a modular sidebar with collapsible sections for Modules and Chapters, utilizing Docusaurus autogenerated sidebars mirroring the file system.
- **FR-002**: Sidebar MUST enforce the hierarchy: Intro → Modules → Chapters → Capstone.
- FR-003: The Intro page MUST include Course Overview, Learning Outcomes, and Navigation Guide sections. It MUST serve as the primary landing page (site root `/`).
- FR-004: Each chapter page MUST follow a consistent template including: Title, Learning Objectives, Prerequisites, Core Concepts, Examples/Exercises, Summary, and References. Empty sections MUST use "N/A" to maintain the structural skeleton.
- FR-005: System MUST provide a standalone Glossary page for Physical AI & Robotics terms, managed as a single alphabetical MDX file and accessible via the Global Navbar.
- FR-006: System MUST provide a standalone Mathematical / ROS / Robotics notation guide page, accessible via the Global Navbar.
- **FR-007**: Navigation depth MUST NOT exceed 3 clicks to reach any content page from the root.
- **FR-008**: The design MUST be responsive and usable on mobile devices (no horizontal scrolling for text, accessible navigation).
- **FR-009**: The design MUST support Docusaurus best practices and use MDX as the canonical format.
- **FR-010**: Existing content MUST be preserved during the restructuring (no rewriting unless required for template fit).

### Key Entities

- **Module**: A high-level grouping of related educational content (e.g., "ROS 2", "Simulation").
- **Chapter**: A specific lesson or unit within a Module, following the standardized template.
- **Auxiliary Page**: Standalone reference content (Glossary, Notation) accessible globally.

## Success Criteria _(mandatory)_

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Navigation depth is reduced to a maximum of 3 clicks for any chapter.
- **SC-002**: 100% of chapters follow the defined structural template (Title -> ... -> References).
- **SC-003**: Google Lighthouse Accessibility score is > 90.
- **SC-004**: Mobile responsiveness check passes (no horizontal scroll on standard viewport widths).
- **SC-005**: Visual parity with the reference design inspiration (clean hierarchy, educational focus).
