# Tasks: Book Redesign

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/005-book-redesign/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required), research.md, data-model.md

**Tests**: Tests are Manual verification via `quickstart.md`. No automated tests requested.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel
- **[Story]**: [US1], [US2], [US3]
- Paths are relative to repo root (e.g., `apps/web/...`)

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic structure verification

- [x] T001 Verify project structure and dependencies in apps/web/package.json
- [x] T002 [P] Create CSS overrides for cleaner UI in apps/web/src/css/custom.css

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core infrastructure configuration (Config, Sidebars, Root URL)

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: Must be complete before User Stories

- [x] T003 Configure autogenerated sidebars in apps/web/sidebars.ts
- [x] T004 Update Docusaurus config (root URL, navbar) in apps/web/docusaurus.config.ts
- [x] T005 Remove default landing page components in apps/web/src/pages/index.tsx
- [x] T006 [P] Remove HomepageFeatures component in apps/web/src/components/HomepageFeatures/
- [x] T007 Create content validation script in scripts/validate-content-structure.js

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - Site config is set, old landing page gone.

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Seamless Navigation (Priority: P1) 🎯 MVP

**Goal**: Students can navigate course structure from site root.

**Independent Test**: Verify `http://localhost:3000/` loads Intro and sidebar is visible.

### Implementation for User Story 1

- [x] T008 [US1] Update Intro module frontmatter for root slug in apps/web/modules/01-intro/index.md
- [x] T009 [US1] Verify/Rename module folders for strict ordering in apps/web/modules/

**Checkpoint**: Site root works, navigation is functional.

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - Consistent Learning Experience (Priority: P1)

**Goal**: All chapters follow predictable structure.

**Independent Test**: Run validation script and verify all chapters pass or have "N/A".

### Implementation for User Story 2

- [x] T010 [US2] Run validation script and identify non-compliant chapters
- [x] T011 [US2] Update Chapter 01 template in apps/web/modules/02-ros2/01-nodes-topics.md (Sample)
- [x] T012 [US2] Update Chapter 02 template in apps/web/modules/03-gazebo-unity/01-simulation-basics.md (Sample)
- [x] T013 [US2] Update remaining chapters to match template (Batch task)

**Checkpoint**: All chapters follow strict structure.

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - Reference & Auxiliary Support (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Quick access to Glossary and Notation.

**Independent Test**: Glossary and Notation pages load from Navbar.

### Implementation for User Story 3

- [x] T014 [P] [US3] Create standalone Glossary page in apps/web/src/pages/glossary.md
- [x] T015 [P] [US3] Create standalone Notation guide in apps/web/src/pages/notation.md
- [x] T016 [US3] Verify Navbar links in apps/web/docusaurus.config.ts (if not covered in T004)

**Checkpoint**: Auxiliary pages are accessible.

## Phase 6: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

**Purpose**: Final cleanup

- [x] T017 Run final build check with `npm run build` in apps/web
- [x] T018 Verify mobile responsiveness

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies.
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup. BLOCKS all stories.
- **User Stories (Phase 3+)**: Depend on Foundational.

### User Story Dependencies

- **US1 (Navigation)**: Independent after Foundation.
- **US2 (Consistency)**: Independent after Foundation.
- **US3 (Auxiliary)**: Independent after Foundation.

### Parallel Opportunities

- T006 (Remove component) parallel with T003/T004.
- T014 (Glossary) and T015 (Notation) parallel.
- US1, US2, US3 can largely run in parallel after Phase 2.

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First
1. Complete Phase 1 & 2.
2. Complete US1 (Navigation).
3. Validate Root URL and Sidebar.
4. Deploy MVP.

### Full Feature
1. Complete MVP.
2. Run US2 (Structure enforcement).
3. Add US3 (Aux pages).
