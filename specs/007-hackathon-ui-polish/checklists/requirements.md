# Specification Quality Checklist: Hackathon-Winning UI & UX Polish

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-12-19

- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows

## Notes

- The specification successfully defines "Hackathon Winning" quality through high-impact visual descriptors (glow, glassmorphism, motion) without prescribing specific JS libraries like Framer Motion or specific CSS frameworks (maintaining the Docusaurus/Infima focus).
- All items pass. Ready for planning.
