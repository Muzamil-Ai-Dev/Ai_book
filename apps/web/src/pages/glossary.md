# Glossary of Terms

## A

**Actuator**: A component of a machine that is responsible for moving and controlling a mechanism or system, for example by opening a valve. In simple terms, it is a "mover".

**Agent**: An entity that perceives its environment through sensors and acting upon that environment through actuators.

## D

**DDS (Data Distribution Service)**: A middleware standard for real-time, data-centric publish-subscribe communication. Used by ROS 2.

**DoF (Degrees of Freedom)**: The number of independent parameters that define its configuration or state. A robot arm typically has 6 or 7 DoF.

## E

**End-Effector**: The device at the end of a robotic arm, designed to interact with the environment. The "hand" of the robot.

## K

**Kinematics**: The branch of mechanics concerned with the motion of objects without reference to the forces which cause the motion.

## L

**Lidar (Light Detection and Ranging)**: A remote sensing method that uses light in the form of a pulsed laser to measure ranges (variable distances) to the Earth.

## M

**MPC (Model Predictive Control)**: An advanced method of process control that is used to control a process while satisfying a set of constraints.

## P

**Physical AI**: The application of AI techniques (Deep Learning, RL) to physical systems (robots) interacting with the real world.

## R

**ROS 2 (Robot Operating System)**: An open-source robotics middleware suite.

## S

**SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping)**: The computational problem of constructing or updating a map of an unknown environment while simultaneously keeping track of an agent's location within it.

## U

**URDF (Unified Robot Description Format)**: An XML format for representing a robot model.

## V

**VLA (Vision-Language-Action)**: A type of multimodal model that takes vision and language as input and outputs robot actions.

## Z

**ZMP (Zero Moment Point)**: A concept in the dynamics of legged locomotion. It specifies the point where the total of horizontal inertia and gravity forces equals zero.
